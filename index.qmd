# [💼🧑‍🎓 We are looking for 2 PhD Students to join our team in Fall 2026!](join.qmd)
:::

Welcome to the **G**eospatial **A**nalytics, **T**echnology and **O**pen **R**esearch (GATOR) Lab at the [University of Florida](https://ufl.edu). We are part of the [Geomatics Program](https://ffgs.ifas.ufl.edu/about/geomatics/) in the [School of Forest, Fisheries and Geomatics Sciences](https://sffgs.ifas.ufl.edu) at [UF/IFAS](https://ifas.ufl.edu).

We are located at the [Fort Lauderdale Research and Education Center](https://flrec.ifas.ufl.edu) within the Miami metropolitan area.


## Our Work

Broadly speaking, we are interested in harnessing the latest technological and methodological advancements in geographic information science. Our work focuses on the convergence of geospatial science, artificial intelligence, and scalable computing. Our research develops scientifically rigorous and scalable frameworks to transform massive geospatial datasets into actionable insights for environmental and societal challenges.

## Research Pillars

- **Scalable Geospatial Data Science & Analytics**: Leveraging high-performance computing and cloud-native technologies to overcome the analysis bottleneck of massive spatiotemporal datasets.

- **GeoAI and Responsible Automation**: Harnessing Large Language Models (LLMs) and agentic AI for geospatial reasoning, while establishing safeguards against geographic bias and misinformation.

- **Open Source, Open Data, and Societal Impact**: Ensuring research transparency and community value by translating advanced methods into sustainable open-source tools and accessible data products.

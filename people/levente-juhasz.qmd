## Biography
Dr. Levente Juhász is an Assistant Professor in the Geomatics program at the University of Florida. He earned his PhD in Geomatics from UF in 2018 before serving as a Research Associate Professor at Florida International University. His career is dedicated to pushing the boundaries of geospatial analytics through innovation, interdisciplinarity, and community-driven open science.

## Research Interests
His work focuses on the convergence of geospatial science, artificial intelligence, and scalable computing. Key areas include:

* **GeoAI:** Developing frameworks for geospatial reasoning using Large Language Models (LLMs).
* **Spatial Data Integrity:** Interrogating the quality, bias, and malicious defacement of crowdsourced data (e.g., VGI and OpenStreetMap).
* **Climate Resilience:** Building scalable environmental decision support systems, such as the EPA-funded "Future Shorelines" project.

## Lab History
Founded in 2026, the GATOR Lab marks Dr. Juhász's return to the University of Florida to establish a high-performance hub for geospatial data science.

<section id="hello-welcome" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="hello-welcome">Hello &amp; Welcome!</h2>
<p>I am excited to announce the launch of the <strong>Geospatial Analytics, Technology and Open Research (GATOR) Lab</strong> at the University of Florida. I accepted a position of Assistant Professor of Geospatial Analytics in Geomatics from the Spring 2026 semester. This marks my return to UF after a 7-year spell at Florida International University as research faculty. I am beyond excited to be back at UF and to continue my research in geospatial analytics, technology and open research.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="why-gator">Why GATOR?</h2>
<p>The GATOR acronym is a play on words. It stands for <strong>Geospatial Analytics, Technology and Open Research</strong>. It represents the <strong>G</strong>eospatial (or Geomatics), <strong>A</strong>nalytics, <strong>T</strong>echnology and <strong>O</strong>pen <strong>R</strong>esearch pillars of my research. As an alumnus, and now faculty member I also found it important to pay tribute to the Florida <strong>Gators</strong>🐊, and ground our lab’s mission within <strong>The Gator Nation</strong>.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="whats-ahead">What’s ahead?</h2>
<p>I am currently in the process of setting up our core infrastructure. The next and ongoing major step is to recruit. I am currently seeking <strong>two fully funded PhD students</strong> to join the lab. This is an exciting opportunity not only for me, but for the first few lab members, who will be an important part of establishing the lab’s culture and direction. I am not just looking for the usual candidates, but for people who are passionate about open science and eager to solve complex spatial problems through a data-science lens. While an excellent academic background is important, I am more interested in your intellectual curiosity and a critical mindset. I can’t stress the importance of this enough. Finding a mutual fit will make or break this experience. Committing to a long PhD program is a major decision. I want to commit to your future success as much as the success of the GATOR Lab, therefore, I am very intentional and selective about who I recruit. I expect you to be the same with making sure that the GATOR Lab and my mentorship are a good fit for you. With that being said, I am interested in the person behind the CV, and I am open to discussing your interests and aspirations. If you are interested in joining the lab, please consult the <a href="../../join.html">join</a> page for more information.</p>
<p>It is my hope that the lab will extend beyond PhD students. In the future, I plan to recruit postdocs, visiting scholars, and collaborators to push the boundaries of geospatial science. I am also interested in working with industry partners, and I am open to discussing potential collaborations, which will benefit the lab in many ways: it will inform our research, teaching, and help us stay at the cutting edge of geospatial analytics and technology.</p>

<section id="where-are-we-located" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="where-are-we-located">Where are we located?</h2>
<p>We are located in sunny South Florida, at the <a href="https://flrec.ifas.ufl.edu">Fort Lauderdale Research &amp; Education Center</a>. While not being located in Gainesville may seem unusual, it is a great location for research and collaboration. South Florida (Miami - Ft. Lauderdale - West Palm Beach) is a vibrant metropolitan area. It is a great place to be, and it also provides a great environment for research and collaboration: it is a hub of innovation and creativity, with a diverse population and a rich cultural heritage. It also lies at the forefront of man-made and environmental challenges waiting to be solved by science.</p>

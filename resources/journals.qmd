We monitor key geographic information science (GIScience) journals to track the evolution of the field as well as to provide a resource for researchers in the GIScience community and related fields to optimize their publication strategies. The dashboard is based on the paper titled ["Assessing publication trends in selected GIScience journals"](https://doi.org/10.1080/13658816.2024.2347306).

## Launch Dashboard
The dashboard is built with shinylive and it runs completely in your browser using WebAssembly. It may take a minute or so to load the R packages and data initially. Sinylive caches these resources efficiently so once everything is loaded, the dashboard should be responsive even during subsequent interactions.

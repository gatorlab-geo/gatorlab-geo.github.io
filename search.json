By integrating high-resolution topographic and bathymetric data with NOAA sea-level rise trajectories, the tool provides parcel-level visualizations and cross-sections to assist practitioners in siting and designing living shorelines. This phase upgrades the database with novel attributes—including seagrass coverage and sediment type—and extends geographic coverage across Martin and Palm Beach Counties, as well as implements functionality improvements, such as dynamic profiling. Supported by a growing network of 23 partners, the project leverages stakeholder input to streamline permitting and improve coastal adaptation planning."

While an excellent academic background is important, I am more interested in your intellectual curiosity and a critical mindset. I can’t stress the importance of this enough. Finding a mutual fit will make or break this experience. Committing to a long PhD program is a major decision. I want to commit to your future success as much as the success of the GATOR Lab, therefore, I am very intentional and selective about who I recruit. I expect you to be the same with making sure that the GATOR Lab and my mentorship are a good fit for you. With that being said, I am interested in the person behind the CV, and I am open to discussing your interests and aspirations. If you are interested in joining the lab, please consult the join page for more information.\nIt is my hope that the lab will extend beyond PhD students. In the future, I plan to recruit postdocs, visiting scholars, and collaborators to push the boundaries of geospatial science. I am also interested in working with industry partners, and I am open to discussing potential collaborations, which will benefit the lab in many ways: it will inform our research, teaching, and help us stay at the cutting edge of geospatial analytics and technology."
